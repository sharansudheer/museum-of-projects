# Set Up OpenSSH in Windows 10/11

## Introduction -

- If there are other OpenSSH Clients installed in the system, it will give rise to conflicts (I don't know why even though the Path is already defined in bashrc).
  
- Like if you have an OpenSSH thing installed in the system previously and you opt the Git installer's SSH client, it bites back in the Arse.

```powershell
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
````

- That would just add to the chaos, instead install the openSSH client Server and Client by probably compiling the below package
[openssh](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases)

- Then we have to add the ssh keys to the SSH server so that the key is automatically added and pulled on start up, ready to use, rather than ssh -T every time we want to pull or push changes to a remote repo via ssh.

```powershell
Start-Service sshd
```
- Then -

```powershell
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'
````
