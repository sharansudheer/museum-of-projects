 - "Why is Everybody soo serious these days". There's a lot of fun in The everyday world. We just need to think in that perspective, Puns and Buns are the way. Mental Health of employees will also benefit from it.

 - I am not working in a corporate now, but from the accounts of friends who are, many of their day to day life is like that of a Robot on an Endless Loop. -><br>
> Wake Up -> Get Ready For Work -> Long Commute to Work ->  Daily Scrum and Meetings, same old routine -> EOD -> Long Commute to Home/Place of Stay -> Sleep -> Repeat üîÅ

- I am no Psychology Major from a uni, but, I am just pointing out how Mental Health is neglected almost everywhere, even though "companies" advertise "Mental Health First" second, etc like a podium.

- Because, people are afraid to speak out about their person problems, fearing that they'll lose everything they once had.

- Like, they would have lost a lot in their life leading up to this present moment, a lot of sacrifices and loses. And a stable source of income might be THE, I emphasise here, THE ONLY PILLAR holding their life in place.

- So "Hey, I lost a lot till this present moment, I just have to gulp it down and just move forward, Don't Worry now, just worry about the Future".

- Future - People are living in the future and neglecting what is happening in the present, or the present is giving them flashbacks of what happened in the past. Like a loop similar to the series **Dark**

- Now you see, this Topic is one Giant Rabbit Hole, NO person dare wants to touch it or move it, because it will or it might trigger an entire community.

- Like "Holy Shite Balls, I just stepped on a Fire Ant's Nest in lawn."
