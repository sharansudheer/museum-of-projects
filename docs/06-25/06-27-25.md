## My Wish List:- 

- Set Up a Home Lab with 10 gig intranet and 1 gig Internet with a solid Gateway.

- Have a GPU Lab with 2 or more scalable GPUs in the server. For Research in LLMs and AGI Code Gen, Sythentic Dataset generation that is more or less organic looking.

- I will have to deal with the power supply and redundancy later on.

- Commit and come up quality content.

- Try re-inventing the wheel like I am doing currently with [CimplyAwesome](https://github.com/sharansudheer/rust-cms-fullstack-app) - Approaching the world of CMS and content delivery software with a new pair of eyes.
